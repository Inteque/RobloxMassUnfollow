# RobloxMassUnfollow
Simple JavaScript code to unfollow for 100 people for you automatically.

# Okay, but how do I use it?
First, edit the unfollow.js script. Replace **USERID** with the userId of your Roblox account.
Then, you want to go to the Roblox site. Right click and go into *Inspect element*. Go to the network monitoring tab and click on any POST request. Scroll all the way to the bottom of the Request Headers and you will find something called **x-csrf-token**. Copy this value and paste it in **PLACEHOLDER** in the script.
Now, copy your edited script and paste it in the console of *Inspect element*. You should have unfollowed 100 people after a few seconds.
